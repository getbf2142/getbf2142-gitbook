### About Us

GetBF2142.net is a little fan website made by some die-hards of the franchise!

Many of us still love the game up to this day, but it is getting harder and harder day by day to actually get the game from a working source and to play it with friends without issues. We understand all these struggles and that's why we made this website.

Our goal is to provide all the necessary resources and information all in one place so that everyone else who still want to play this 15-year-old game today can have access to it and have fun in no time!

If it ever comes to a day that this website has to be taken down, then let's be it. But before that ever happens, we will still be here trying our very best to help out those who still want to play the game.&#x20;

Just a side note that we made this website out of good intentions. There is no ads or revenues made out from this project (We actually consumed our own money to buy the domain). We also never meant to support priated games nor encorage any infringement of copyrights.&#x20;

As die-hard fans of the franchise, we would always want to pay our full respects to EA and DICE for making such a good game. But the game itself has been abandoned for so many years from now with no better ways to play online or buy online, so we really have no choice but to resort to our very own little ways to get and play the game. We're terribly sorry for what we've done here if it upsets you or makes you feel uncomfortable.
