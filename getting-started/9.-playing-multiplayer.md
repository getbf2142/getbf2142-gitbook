# ⑨ Playing a multiplayer game

{% hint style="warning" %}
* If you are joining a vanilla server, you must unselect all the modded options such as Remaster Mod, Blood Patch and HUD-Fix in the launcher before launching the game.
* You should join the server with a compatible mod. You cannot join a vanilla server with a mod or vice versa.
* You need to install custom maps to play on Reclamation servers.
{% endhint %}

## Joining a Local Server \[LAN]

A local server is a game server that can be accessed within a LAN network. The server will appear on the local server browser once it's up. This option is suitable for hosting a game within your house, i.e. playing with your family.

1. Log in to the game.
2. Click <mark style="color:blue;">MULTIPLAY</mark>.
3. Click <mark style="color:blue;">LOCAL</mark>.
4. In the <mark style="color:blue;">JOIN</mark> tab, click <mark style="color:blue;">UPDATE LIST</mark> until the LAN server appears on the list.
5. ​Double-click on the server to join the server.

<summary>Solution: Server Not Found in Local Server Browser</summary>

Make sure the one who hosts the server is within your LAN network. The server becomes a modded server if the server hoster launched the game with a mod.

If the above does not work for you, for example, you cannot find the server on the local server browser even after the server is up, then follow these steps:

Click "**ONLINE**". In the "**ADVANCED**" tab, click "**CONNECT TO IP**". Type in the server's local IP address. Click "**OK**".

A local IP address is usually in the pattern of 192.168.x.x. The server hoster will know his or her local IP address on the loading screen once the server is launched.

But have you ever wondered why? Like why your LAN server just doesn't show up in the local server browser, or why you just can't see your friend's server!

Most probably, it's because your PC is having multiple network adapters, especially when you have applications like Hamachi, VirtualBox or VMWare installed.

The simplest solution is to disable all other network adapters except the one for your current network.&#x20;

1. To do so, go to "**Network and Sharing Center**" in your control panel.&#x20;
2. Choose "**Change adapter**" settings.&#x20;
3. Right-click on the adapter that you want to disable and click "**Disable**".&#x20;
4. Check this on your server computer first, followed by the computers connecting to the server.

## Joining a Public Server \[WAN]

​A public server is a game server that appears on the online server browser and is accessible through the Internet. That's why it's called a public server. You will be playing with random people around the world.

1. Log in to the game.
2. Click <mark style="color:blue;">MULTIPLAY</mark>.
3. Click <mark style="color:blue;">ONLINE</mark>.
4. In the <mark style="color:blue;">ADVANCED</mark> tab, uncheck all the options in the filter and click <mark style="color:blue;">UPDATE LIST</mark>.
5. Now, you should see a list of public servers in the server browser. Double-click a server to play.

{% hint style="info" %}
​The green icon beside the 2142 icon tells you whether the server is modded or not. Green indicates vanilla (i.e., unmodded) while red indicates modded. Always launch the game without the mod to join any servers with the green icon.

## Joining a Private Server \[WAN]

A private WAN server is a game server that does not appear on the online server browser but is accessible over the Internet if you know its public IP address. This option is very suitable for hosting a game with your friends if you don't want to be disturbed.

1. Log in to the game.
2. Click <mark style="color:blue;">MULTIPLAY</mark>.
3. Click <mark style="color:blue;">ONLINE</mark>.
4. In the <mark style="color:blue;">ADVANCED</mark> tab, click <mark style="color:blue;">CONNECT TO IP</mark>.
5. Type in the server's public IP address and change the [port number](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] whenever necessary.
6. Click <mark style="color:blue;">OK</mark>.

[^1]: 17567 is the default port.
