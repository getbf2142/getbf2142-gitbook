# 4. Installing â€‹BF2142 Hub

BF2142 Hub is a handy tool that patches your Battlefield 2142 with OpenSpy or NovGames (i.e. master servers) components, which then allows you to get back into the game and play online.&#x20;

It was developed by the Reclamation Team. You may join their discord server to receive the latest updates about their project.

It's necessary to install BF2142 Hub because it provides a click-to-go method to install OpenSpy or NovGames patches. You need these custom patches to pass through the login page and to find servers from the server browser.
