# 1. Installing Base Game

## Procedures

{% hint style="warning" %}
if you're using our preferred setup (i.e., primary download), an older version of the game will be installed onto your computer. You will then have to follow the instructions on the next page to fully update the game from `v1.01` all the way up to `v1.51`.
{% endhint %}

1. Download <mark style="color:blue;">Setup.rar</mark>.
2. Create a new folder on your desktop. Open <mark style="color:blue;">Setup.rar</mark>.&#x20;
3. Drag and drop all the items from the .rar into the new folder.
4. Look for <mark style="color:blue;">setup.exe</mark> in the folder. Double-click to run the installer.
5. Click <mark style="color:blue;">Yes</mark> when the dialogue <mark style="color:blue;">Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?</mark> pops up.
6. Follow the wizard instructions to complete the installation. \[<mark style="color:red;">See Remarks</mark>]\
   You may refer to the special remarks below for more in-depth guidance throughout the process.
7. When the installation completes, uncheck the option <mark style="color:blue;">View the README file</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">Create desktop shortcuts</mark>.

## Downloads

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Primary Sources" %}
This setup is extracted directly from a physical copy (i.e., game disc) published by EA Taiwan back in 2005. The special <mark style="color:blue;">Standard Edition</mark> contains the following locales:

English, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Russian

Given that the setup only holds an early version (i.e.,`v1.01`) of the game, you will have to follow the instructions on the next page to have the game patched to the latest version.&#x20;

If you are new and you don't know what we're doing here, we suggest always sticking to the primary download resources as they are the major references throughout our tutorials.

If you have concerns about the sources we provide, try installing an AntiVirus in advance or downloading the base game from other sources. It is important that you feel comfortable with what you are doing here.



{% hint style="danger" %}
This is not really a legit way to download the game.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



I know, you know, we all know that, but this is becoming the only option left to get the game nowadays apart from buying an old second-hand copy from Amazon that doesn't allow you to log in anymore.

{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Alternative Sources" %}
The resources in this section are already patched to the latest version (i.e.,`v1.51`).

However, the files and sources here haven't been tested by us, so use them at your own risk.

If you choose to download the game from the following links, you may skip the instructions on the next page about patching the game to `v1.51`. Besides that, the cd keys listed in the remarks section below are for Standard Edition only and will not work properly for the <mark style="color:blue;">Deluxe Edition</mark> here. If there're no relevant instructions inside the given .zip, you may search in Google <mark style="color:blue;">BF2142 Deluxe Edition Keys</mark> to apply the correct keys.

If you're new and you don't know what we're doing here, we suggest always sticking to the primary download resources as they are the major references throughout our tutorials.

If you have concerns about the sources we provide, try installing an AntiVirus in advance or downloading the base game from other sources. It's important that you feel comfortable with what you're doing here.

{% tab title="Buy Used Copies in Amazon" %}
The only way to obtain the game legally is to buy a used (i.e., second-hand) copy.&#x20;

A used copy usually means the product key is already activated or expired.

For that very reason, we don't really recommend buying a second-hand copy, especially after the game's shutdown in 2013.

But you can still buy one if you want to at least show some support to the original buyer, or simply because of nostalgia.&#x20;

Nostalgia is a good reason though. Many of our core members do have a physical copy just because we love the game very much. Some of us even got the disc in 2005.

As we always say, we are real Battlefield lovers, and that's why we made this website.

2. If you see the popup <mark style="color:blue;">This game has only been tested on WinXP(32bit)</mark>, feel safe to ignore this warning as the game works perfectly on all Windows platforms starting from Windows XP and onwards.
3. When you're asked to input the key by the wizard, simply pick any one of these cd keys to pass through the prompt. The keys are applicable to primary downloads only.\

   * SVMV-LBNV-W7W5-J3X4-1911

   * UTFP-4DMN-D2U0-X3T3-1911​
   * TRCL-YBIJ-D4H4-Y3O5-1911\

4. You're strongly advised to install the game to the default path (i.e., <mark style="color:blue;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Battlefield 2142</mark>), but it's also fine if you install it in another location.
5. You're strongly advised to install the <mark style="color:blue;">English</mark> version of the game if you want to take advantage of the <mark style="color:blue;">HD English fonts</mark> from Project Remaster (i.e., mod) that we're going to install later.
6. BattleCammo is a VoIP service that allows you to voice chat in-game. Believe it or not, you won't be using it that much. You may simply skip configuring it by clicking the <mark style="color:blue;">Cancel</mark> button.
7. GameSpy Comrade is a community gaming application providing functions like friends, stats, and instant messaging. However, it no longer works due to GameSpy's shutdown in 2013. You may therefore skip installing it by clicking the <mark style="color:blue;">No, install GameSpy Comrade later</mark> button.
8. EA Master Server no longer exists due to GameSpy's shutdown in 2013. Click <mark style="color:blue;">REGISTER LATER</mark> to skip registering an EA account.
