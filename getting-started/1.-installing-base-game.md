# 1. Installing Base Game

{% hint style="info" %}
Before proceeding to install the game, don't forget to double-check the System Requirements to see if your device can run the game or not.
{% endhint %}

## Procedures

1. Download <mark style="color:blue;">Setup.rar</mark> from [Downloads](1.-installing-base-game.md#downloads) -> Primary Sources.
2. Create a new folder on your desktop. Open <mark style="color:blue;">Setup.rar</mark>.
3. Drag and drop all the items in the .rar file into the new folder.
4. Look for <mark style="color:blue;">setup.exe</mark> in the folder. Double-click to run the installer.
5. Click <mark style="color:blue;">Yes</mark> when the dialogue <mark style="color:blue;">Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?</mark> pops up.
6. Follow the wizard instructions to complete the installation. Some of the important remarks are provided [here](1.-installing-base-game.md#wizard-remarks).
7. When the installation completes, uncheck the option <mark style="color:blue;">View the README file</mark>. **DO NOT** launch the game yet as the game has not been patched to the latest version.
8. Proceed to [install v1.51 patch](2.-installing-v1.51-patch.md). **DO NOT** try to omit this step.

## Downloads

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Primary Sources" %}
**Battlefield 2142 Standard Edition v1.01**

This setup is extracted directly from a <mark style="color:blue;">Standard Edition</mark> retail disc published by EA back in 2005. It contains the following locales:

English, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Russian

Since this setup only holds an early version (i.e.,`v1.01`) of the game, you [**must**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] follow the instructions on the next page right after finishing all the steps on this page to have the game correctly patched to the latest version  (i.e.,`v1.51`).

**If you are new to the modding process, we suggest always sticking to the primary sources as they are the main references we use throughout all our tutorials.**

If you have concerns about the sources we provide, try installing an AntiVirus in advance or downloading the base game from sources that you trust. It's very important that you feel comfortable with what you're doing here.

Note that this is not a legit way to download the game. But this is becoming the only option left to get the game nowadays apart from buying a second-hand copy from Amazon that doesn't allow you to log in anymore.

**Battlefield 2142 Deluxe Edition v1.51**

The setup provided in this section are already patched to the latest version (i.e.,`v1.51`). However, these files have not been tested by us, so use them at your own risk.

If you choose to download the game from the following links, you may skip the part about patching the game to `v1.51`. However, the serial keys listed in the remarks section that follows are for Standard Edition only, and will not work properly for the <mark style="color:blue;">Deluxe Edition</mark> here.

{% tab title="Buy Used Copies in Amazon" %}
**Battlefield 2142 Deluxe Edition Retail DVD**

The only way to obtain the game "legitimately" is to buy a second-hand retail DVD.

A used copy usually means the product key is already activated or expired.

For that very reason, we do not really recommend buying a second-hand copy, especially after the game's termination in 2014.

But you can still buy one if you want to at least show some support to the seller, or simply because of nostalgia.&#x20;

Nostalgia is a good reason though. Many of us do have a physical copy just because we love the game very much. Some of us even got the disc as early as in 2005.

As we always say, we are real Battlefield lovers, and that's why we made this website.

2. If you see the popup <mark style="color:blue;">This game has only been tested on WinXP(32bit)</mark>, feel safe to ignore this warning as the game works perfectly fine on all Windows platforms ranging from Windows XP to Windows 11.
3. When you are asked to provide the serial code, simply pick one of the keys below to pass through the prompt. The keys are only applicable to the setup downloaded from [Downloads](1.-installing-base-game.md#downloads) -> Primary Sources.\

4. You're strongly advised to install the game to the default path (i.e., <mark style="color:blue;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Battlefield 2142</mark>), but it's also fine if you install it in another location.
5. You're strongly advised to install the <mark style="color:blue;">English</mark> version of the game if you want to take advantage of the <mark style="color:blue;">HD English fonts</mark> from Project Remaster (i.e., mod) that we're going to install later.
6. BattleCammo is a VoIP service that allows you to voice chat in-game. Believe it or not, you won't be using it that much. You may simply skip configuring it by clicking the <mark style="color:blue;">Cancel</mark> button.
7. GameSpy Comrade is a community gaming application providing functions like friends, stats, and instant messaging. However, it no longer works due to GameSpy's shutdown in 2013. You may therefore skip installing it by clicking the <mark style="color:blue;">No, install GameSpy Comrade later</mark> button.
8. EA Master Server no longer exists due to GameSpy's shutdown in 2013. Click <mark style="color:blue;">REGISTER LATER</mark> to skip registering an EA account.
