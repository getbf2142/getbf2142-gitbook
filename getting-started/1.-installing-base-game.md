# 1. Installing Base Game

## Procedures

{% hint style="info" %}
This setup will install an older version of the game onto your computer, given that you are using the primary download.

Follow the instructions on the next page to fully update the game from `v1.01` all the way up to `v1.51`.
{% endhint %}

1. Download "**`Setup.rar`**".
2. Create a new folder on your desktop. Open "**`Setup.rar`**". Drag and drop all the items from the .rar into the new folder.
3. Look for "**`setup.exe`**" in the folder. Double click to run it.
4. Click "**Yes"** when the dialogue "**Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?**" pops up.
5. Follow the wizard instructions to complete the installation. You may refer to the special remarks below for more in-depth guidance throughout the process. \[<mark style="color:red;">Read Remarks</mark>]
6. When the installation completes, uncheck the option "**View the README file.**" and "**Create desktop shortcuts.**".

## Downloads

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Primary Sources" %}
This setup is extracted directly from a physical copy (i.e., game disc) published by EA Taiwan back in 2005. The edition contains the following translations (i.e., locale):

English, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Russian

Given that the setup only holds an early version (i.e.,`v1.01`) of the game, you will have to follow the instructions on the next page to have the game patched to the latest version.&#x20;

If you have credibilty concerns about the sources we provide, try installing an AntiVirus in advance or downloading the base game from other sources. It is important that you feel comfortable with what you are doing here. We won't force anyone to download anything they don't need, they dont want, or they don't trust here.&#x20;



{% hint style="info" %}
Warning: This is not really a legit way to download the game. I know, You know, We all know that. But this is the only option left to get the game nowadays apart from buying an old second-hand copy from Amazon that doesn't allow you to login anymore.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Alternative Sources" %}
The resources in this section are already patched to the latest version (i.e.,`v1.51`).

However, these files have not been tested by us. **Use at your own risk.**

If you choose to download the game from the following links, you may skip the instructions on the next page regarding the installation of `v1.51` patch. The keys provided below (Standard Edition) will not work as well for these links (Deluxe Edition). If there are no relevant instructions inside the given .zip, you may search in Google "BF2142 Deluxe Edition Keys" to get that working.&#x20;

If you are new and you don't know what we're doing here, we suggest always sticking to the primary download resources as they are the majr references for our tutorials.

If you have credibilty concerns about the sources we provide, try installing an AntiVirus in advance or downloading the base game from other sources. It is important that you feel comfortable with what you are doing. We won't force anyone to download anything they don't need, they dont want, or they don't trust here.&#x20;

{% tab title="Buy Used Copies in Amazon" %}
The only way to obtain the game legally is to buy a used copy.&#x20;

A used copy usually means the product key is already activated or expired.

For that very reason, we don't really recommend buying a second-hand copy especially after the game's shutdown in 2013.

But you can still buy one if you want to at least show some support to the original buyer, or simply because of nostalgia. Nostalgia is a good reason though. Many of our core members do have a physical copy just because we love the game very much. Some of us even got the disc since 2005.
