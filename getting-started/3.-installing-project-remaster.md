# 3. Installing ​Project Remaster

{% hint style="warning" %}
We strongly recommend installing the Project Remaster Mod for an enhanced gaming experience that aligns with 2020s standards. If you are new to modding, our tutorial heavily relies on PR, so it is advised to follow along.

Project Remaster is a high-quality enhancement modification for Battlefield 2142.

It aims to remaster this 15-year-old game for a complete 2020s experience by introducing high-quality textures, realistic animations and new weapons into the game engine.&#x20;

The mod was developed and maintained by a modding group called Project Remaster Team. You may join their discord server to receive support and the latest updates about their project.
