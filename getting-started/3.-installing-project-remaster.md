# 3. Installing ​Project Remaster

{% hint style="warning" %}
The installation of PR (Project Remaster) is optional, but strongly recommended for an enhanced gaming experience that aligns with 2020 standards. If you're new to the game or modding, our tutorial heavily relies on PR, so it's advised to follow along. However, if you're already familiar with the process, you may opt to skip this step.
{% endhint %}

Project Remaster is a high-quality enhancement modification for Battlefield 2142.

It aims to remaster this 15-year-old game for a complete 2020+ experience by introducing high-quality textures, realistic animations and new weapons into the game engine.&#x20;

The mod was developed and maintained by a modding group called Project Remaster Team. You may join their discord server to receive support and the latest updates about their project.
