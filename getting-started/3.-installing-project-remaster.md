## Procedures

{% hint style="info" %}
​Installation of this mod is completely optional but is highly recommended.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you already have an older version of the mod installed, you must uninstall it first before installing the newer version.
{% endhint %}

1. Download "**`project_remaster_v14_setup_BETA12.exe`**".
2. Double click to run it. It may take a while for it to start. Please be patient.
3. Click "**Yes**" when the dialogue "**Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device?**" pops up.
4. ​Click "**More info**" and then "**Run anyway**" if the dialogue "**Windows protected your PC**" (Windows Defender SmartScreen) pops up.
5. Follow the wizard instructions to complete the installation.​
6. When the installation completes, uncheck the option "**Open README**" and "**Start Remaster Launcher**".

{% hint style="info" %}
**Step 5:** You're advised to select the option "**English language (HD Fonts)​**" when you see the prompt message "Please select the language that the game should run in." You should also install the mod to the correct path, i.e. the "**`/Battlefield 2142/`**" folder.&#x20;

## Remarks

{% hint style="info" %}
Some AntiVirus may block this .exe file. Some may even block the installation midway.&#x20;

If that happens, you may have to do some tweaking to your AntiVirus in order to stop it from overreacting to this .exe file.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You will have four folders in your "**`/Battlefield 2142/mods/`**" folder once the installation is completed.



1. **bf2142** is the vanilla game.
2. **Project\_Remaster\_v14** is the main-mod folder.\
   It contains the complete mod (textures, models, maps etc.) and will be used for hosting your multi-player / single-player game.
3. **Project\_Remaster\_v14\_offline** is a mini-mod for offline singleplayer.\
   • It works without an internet connection.\
   • The customization screen will not work.\
   • You have pre-defined soldier load-outs and kit load-outs with some fixed unlocks.\
   • Loot dead bots backpacks to use another load-outs.
4. **Project\_Remaster\_v14\_vanilla\_weapons** is a mini-mod with all weapons and gadgets having their vanilla stats (damage, recoil, rate of fire, amount of ammo etc.).\
   It also removes the new 4th primary rifles from the soldiers. Animations, however, stay the same as in the main mod.
