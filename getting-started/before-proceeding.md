**Classic Setup**

If you want to play the game most classically, you may continue with the current flow by following the instructions from <mark style="color:blue;">4. Installing BF2142 Hub</mark> to <mark style="color:blue;">10. Hosting Servers</mark>. It is also the setup that most of our tutorials on this site focus on.



**Quick Setup**

If you don't want to go through all those clumsy steps that follow, you may skip <mark style="color:blue;">4. Installing BF2142 Hub</mark> to <mark style="color:blue;">10. Hosting Servers</mark>. Refer to the section <mark style="color:blue;">Using BF2142 Unlocker</mark> for more details on how to create or join a game using the intuitive GUI that comes with Project Remaster.

At GetBF2142.net, we have a soft spot for nostalgia, and we believe in teaching newcomers how to install the game classically. While this method may take a few more steps compared to the quick setup, it results in a fully functional game that can be launched using the old GUI. You can then spend your happy moments exploring the game and creating or joining games through it.

However, we do understand the need to provide a generally simpler modding experience for those who want to enjoy the game without more waiting. For this very purpose, a quick setup with the use of BF2142 Unlocker is provided. This tool eliminates the need to install patches yourself and handles everything from joining servers, switching master servers, hosting LAN games, and finding servers in the browser. All you need to do is launch BF2142 Unlocker and use their intuitive off-game GUI to start playing the game.

If you're new to the game or unsure which method to choose, it's better to stick with our classic setup. We provide detailed steps and information on how to install the classic patches and mods. It's also helpful to try the classic setup first because you'll learn a lot about the patching or modding process for BF2142 and why we have these steps in place. This knowledge will help you understand BF2142 Unlocker better as it integrates all these concepts into one.

Lastly, it's worth noting that you can switch to using BF2142 Unlocker later on if you find the classic GUI inconvenient.
