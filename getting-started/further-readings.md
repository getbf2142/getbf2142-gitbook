# Further Readings

Project Remaster's Wiki includes some other very essential details about the game so we would recommend spending some time reading through their materials.

As you can see, the wiki is very well written so you shouldn't miss such a good resource to know the game better. The wiki comes as a built-in feature with Project Remaster. So all you need to do is install Project Remaster and then click the <mark style="color:blue;">Manual</mark> button located at the bottom side of the launcher to launch the offline wiki.
