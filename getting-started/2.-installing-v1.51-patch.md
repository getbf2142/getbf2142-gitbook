# 2. Installing v1.51 Patch

{% hint style="warning" %}
You may skip this step if you already have your game patched to `v1.51`. Whenever you are unsure about your game's version, simply launch the game and you will see the version string near the bottom right corner of the login box. If you cannot launch the game without a disc, it means your game has not been patched to the final version.
{% endhint %}

It's necessary to patch the game to `v1.51` because:

* It removes DRM: You no longer have to install any no-cd cracks to launch the game.
* It adds widescreen support: It makes the game looks better.
* It adds Northern Strike expansion pack content to the game.
* It contains various bug fixes and several additional features.
* It is the game's final version: You gain access to all the game features.
* It is the required version for most existing master servers (e.g., OpenSpy), game servers (e.g., Reclamation) and mods (e.g., Project Remaster).

**What is DRM?**

DRM is an old-school anti-piracy mechanism. When the game was first released in 2005, players had to launch the game with their game discs in order to verify their premium identity and play online.
{% endhint %}

What's special about this installer is that it completely updates your game all the way to the final version regardless of the game's current version or edition that is installed on your system.

In other words, this fan-made installer can patch your game directly to `v1.51` , regardless of whether your game is at `v1.00`, `v1.01` or `v1.50`, or whether you have the Standard Edition or the Deluxe Edition installed.&#x20;

This is in contrast with the official updater, which can only be applied incrementally, i.e., version by version (i.e., `v1.00` / `v1.01` -> `v1.50` -> `v1.51`). By abstracting those intermediate steps, this new installer makes updating the game to the latest version much more user-friendly and straightforward.

## Procedures

1. Download <mark style="color:blue;">BF2142\_Update\_1.51\_Full.exe</mark>.
2. Double-click to run it. It may take a while for it to start.
3. Click <mark style="color:blue;">Yes</mark> when the dialogue <mark style="color:blue;">Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device?</mark> pops up.
4. ​Click <mark style="color:blue;">More Info</mark> and then <mark style="color:blue;">Run Anyway</mark> if the dialogue <mark style="color:blue;">Windows Protected Your PC</mark> (Windows Defender SmartScreen) pops up.
5. Follow the wizard instructions to complete the installation.​

**Step 5:** The patch installer will automatically locate the game folder for you even if you didn't install the game to the default path. That's because the game's path has already become an entry in your system registry.
