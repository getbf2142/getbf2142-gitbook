# 5. Installing OpenSpy Patches

OpenSpy is an open-source GameSpy clone which aims to provide 100% compatibility with GameSpy games. Reclamation is the major BF2142 community that uses the OpenSpy master server.

Apart from Openspy - Reclamation, there are other master servers and communities as well. To name a few, we have NovGames, PlayBF2142 and MAGMA. OpenSpy - Reclamation, however, is the most popular and stable one with a large and active community for support. That's why in this tutorial, we will focus on getting our game to work with OpenSpy.

A master server is a server that holds the database of your login credentials and soldier data. It also propagates (i.e., broadcasts) game servers to the server browser under its reign, while in return a game server regularly reports the player's in-game progress to the master server. You can regard it as a centralised manager for all game servers under its administration

Installing OpenSpy patches to the game forces the game to connect through OpenSpy instead of the dead GameSpy (i.e., the official master server). This allows the game to work again, especially for the login and online part, after GameSpy's shutdown in 2013.

## Installing OpenSpy Patches

{% hint style="warning" %}
​Before proceeding to patch your game, you're strongly advised to backup the following files in your game folder: <mark style="color:blue;">BF2142.exe</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">RendDX9.dll</mark>
{% endhint %}

1. Right-click the <mark style="color:blue;">BF2142 Hub</mark> shortcut on your desktop. \
   Click <mark style="color:blue;">Properties</mark>. In the <mark style="color:blue;">Compatibility</mark> tab, enable <mark style="color:blue;">Run this program as an administrator</mark>.\
   Click <mark style="color:blue;">Apply</mark> and then click <mark style="color:blue;">OK</mark>.
2. Double-click the shortcut to run the app.
3. Click <mark style="color:blue;">Yes</mark> when the dialogue <mark style="color:blue;">Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device?</mark> pops up.
4. In the <mark style="color:blue;">Help</mark> (question mark icon) tab, check whether the <mark style="color:blue;">GamePath</mark> is pointed to the correct destination or not. If it's not, click the gear icon to locate your game folder.
5. Select <mark style="color:blue;">OpenSpy</mark> from the <mark style="color:blue;">Redirects\*</mark> drop-down menu. Click the <mark style="color:blue;">Install</mark> button.

   **Steps 9-11 are optional as they are only required if you want to play on Reclamation's multiplayer servers.**\
   \
   The Reclamation Community uses their own version of maps. So, in order to play on their multiplayer servers, you will have to install their map pack or the map that the server is currently running on.\

9. Under the <mark style="color:blue;">Download</mark> tab, double-click on <mark style="color:blue;">BF2142 MapPack v1.0</mark>. The app will then open your browser and navigate to the download link of the pack. Download <mark style="color:blue;">2142\_MapPack\_v1.zip</mark> (MediaFire, 3.8GB). \[<mark style="color:red;">See Step 9 Info</mark>]
10. Once the download is completed, click the <mark style="color:blue;">MapPack Installer \*</mark> button and select the .zip file you've downloaded.
11. A command-line window will pop up and close once the installation is completed.
12. If everything looks good, close the app.

**Step 9:** There is an option to download the maps individually. To do so, you may refer to the following instructions:

* In the <mark style="color:blue;">Download</mark> tab, click <mark style="color:blue;">Individual Maps</mark>.&#x20;
* Select the maps that you want to download from the <mark style="color:blue;">Available Maps</mark> box and click <mark style="color:blue;">>></mark>.&#x20;
* To uninstall a map, select the map from the <mark style="color:blue;">Installed Maps</mark> box and click <mark style="color:blue;"><<</mark>.

{% hint style="info" %}
Reclamation servers are unmodded, i.e., vanilla servers, but with modified maps. The downloaded maps are installed in the <mark style="color:blue;">/mods/bf2142/Levels</mark> folder, i.e., the vanilla folder.
{% endhint %}

To explore and switch between different master servers, it's better to use BF2142 Unlocker. But let's stick with OpenSpy at the moment until we get a more thorough understanding on how the game works.
