# 5. Installing OpenSpy Patches

OpenSpy and NovGames are fan-made master servers serving their own communities.

There are other master servers and communities as well, such as PlayBF2142 and MAGMA. OpenSpy and NovGames, however, are amongst the most popular ones. That's why in this tutorial, we will mainly focus on these two core services.

A master server holds the database of your login credentials and soldier data. It also propagates (i.e. broadcasts) game servers to the server browser under its reign, while a game server regularly reports your in-game progress to the master server.

Installing OpenSpy / NovGames components to the game forces the game to connect through OpenSpy / NovGames instead of the dead GameSpy (i.e. the official master server). This allows the game to work again, especially for the login and online part, after GameSpy's shutdown in 2013.

## OpenSpy vs NovGames

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="OpenSpy" %}
![OpenSpy Server List](../.gitbook/assets/reclamation\_orig.png)

* English-speaking community
* All unlockable items are unlocked
* Players: 10+ players on weekdays, 30+ at weekends, on Reclamation server​s​
* Servers: Reclamation EU, Reclamation US
* Community: Reclamation \[Discord]
* Gamemodes: Conquest, Conquest Coop
* ​Requirements: Install OpenSpy Components via BF2142 Hub
* Requirements: Install Reclamation's map pack (3.8 GB) or maps that the server is running upon

OpenSpy is recommended over NovGames if you just want to play Project Remaster's coops (both single-player and LAN) while having all the unlocks.

You don't have to play on ranked servers to rank up because you already got all the unlocks right from the beginning.

![NovGames Server List](../.gitbook/assets/novgame\_orig.png)

* Russin-speaking community
* All unlockable items are **NOT** unlocked
* More players: 40+ players on weekdays, 50+ at weekends, on ALLIANCE servers
* Servers: ALLIANCE Mix, ALLIANCE INFANTRY
* Community: NovGames \[Discord]
* Gamemodes: Titan, No Vehicles
* Requirements: Install NovGames Components via BF2142 Hub + Run NovGames Activator once

NovGames is better if you just want to play on a public server and enjoy the vanilla multiplayer experience, especially the Titan mode.​

You have to play on ranked servers to rank up and unlock items.

NovGames Activator changes your cd key so that you don't get auto-kicked on Alliance's servers.

## Installing OpenSpy Patches

We will first go through the installation of OpenSpy Components.&#x20;

That's because you will always find yourself playing with bots (i.e., Conquest Coop) most of the time in single-player, so OpenSpy is really the way to go.&#x20;

Rest assured that we will also guide you through how to switch over to NovGames just in case you want to play some vanilla multi-player games with real people.

{% hint style="warning" %}
​Before proceeding to patch your game, you're strongly advised to backup the following files in your game folder: <mark style="color:blue;">BF2142.exe</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">RendDX9.dll</mark>
{% endhint %}

1. Right-click the <mark style="color:blue;">BF2142 Hub</mark> shortcut on your desktop. \
   Click <mark style="color:blue;">Properties</mark>. In the <mark style="color:blue;">Compatibility</mark> tab, enable <mark style="color:blue;">Run this program as an administrator</mark>.\
   Click <mark style="color:blue;">Apply</mark> and then click <mark style="color:blue;">OK</mark>.
2. Double-click the shortcut to run the app.
3. Click <mark style="color:blue;">Yes</mark> when the dialogue <mark style="color:blue;">Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device?</mark> pops up.
4. In the <mark style="color:blue;">Help</mark> (question mark icon) tab, check whether the <mark style="color:blue;">GamePath</mark> is pointed to the correct destination or not. If it's not, click the gear icon to locate your game folder.
5. Select <mark style="color:blue;">OpenSpy</mark> from the <mark style="color:blue;">Redirects\*</mark> drop-down menu. Click the <mark style="color:blue;">Install</mark> button.
6. Click <mark style="color:blue;">Yes</mark> when the dialogue <mark style="color:blue;">Are you sure you want to patch the game?</mark> pops up.
7. Click <mark style="color:blue;">Confirm</mark> when the dialogue <mark style="color:blue;">Patch completed, Enjoy!</mark> pops up.
8. Make sure all checkmarks (i.e., Patch 1.51, BF2142.exe, RendDX9.d, RendDX9ori.dll) are <mark style="color:green;">green</mark> after patching.\
   \
   **Steps 9-11 are optional as they are only required if you want to play on Reclamation's multiplayer servers.**\
   \
   The Reclamation Community uses their own version of maps. So, in order to play on their multiplayer servers, you will have to install their map pack or the map that the server is currently running on.\

9. Under the <mark style="color:blue;">Download</mark> tab, double-click on <mark style="color:blue;">BF2142 MapPack v1.0</mark>. The app will then open your browser and navigate to the download link of the pack. Download <mark style="color:blue;">2142\_MapPack\_v1.zip</mark> (MediaFire, 3.8GB). \[<mark style="color:red;">See Step 9 Info</mark>]
10. Once the download is completed, click the <mark style="color:blue;">MapPack Installer \*</mark> button and select the .zip file you've downloaded.
11. A command-line window will pop up and close once the installation is completed.
12. If everything looks good, close the app.

**Step 9:** There is an option to download the maps individually. To do so, you may refer to the following instructions:

* In the <mark style="color:blue;">Download</mark> tab, click <mark style="color:blue;">Individual Maps</mark>.&#x20;
* Select the maps that you want to download from the <mark style="color:blue;">Available Maps</mark> box and click <mark style="color:blue;">>></mark>.&#x20;
* To uninstall a map, select the map from the <mark style="color:blue;">Installed Maps</mark> box and click <mark style="color:blue;"><<</mark>.

{% hint style="info" %}
Reclamation servers are unmodded, i.e., vanilla servers, but with modified maps. The downloaded maps are installed in the <mark style="color:blue;">/mods/bf2142/Levels</mark> folder, i.e., the vanilla folder.
{% endhint %}

## Installing NovGames Patches

{% hint style="info" %}
To switch between the 2 master servers, select the corresponding master server in the drop-down menu of BF2142 Hub and click <mark style="color:blue;">Install</mark> to install the components.
{% endhint %}

1. Follow the steps from the above section.&#x20;
2. Select <mark style="color:blue;">NovGames</mark> instead of <mark style="color:blue;">GameSpy</mark> in step 5 and skip steps 9-11. \
   NovGames components do not include RendDX9\_ori.dll, so there will be no checkmark on that option after patching.
3. Download <mark style="color:blue;">Activator2142\_by\_NovGames.exe</mark>. \[<mark style="color:red;">See Step 3 Info</mark>]
4. Run it as an Administrator.
5. Click <mark style="color:blue;">EN</mark>, and then click <mark style="color:blue;">ACTIVATE</mark>.
6. Close the app once the <mark style="color:blue;">Completed</mark> message appears in the diagnose box.

**​Step 3:** You only have to run this app once, and you may delete it afterwards. The activator will replace your old cd key with a new key in your game's registry path. This allows the key to uniquely identify yourself so you don't get auto-kicked on Alliance's servers.
