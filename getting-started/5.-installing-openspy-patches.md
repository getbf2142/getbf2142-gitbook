# 5. Installing OpenSpy Patches

OpenSpy and NovGames are fan-made master servers serving their own communities.

There are other master servers and communities, such as PlayBF2142 and MAGMA. OpenSpy and NovGames, however, are the most popular ones among them, and thus this tutorial will mainly focus on these two services.

A master server holds the database of your login credentials and soldier data, and propagates (i.e. broadcasts) game servers to the server browser under its reign, while a game server regularly reports your in-game progress to the master server.

Installing OpenSpy / NovGames components to the game forces the game to connect through OpenSpy / NovGames instead of the dead GameSpy (i.e. the official master server). This allows the game to work again, especially for the login and online part, after GameSpy's shutdown in 2013.

## OpenSpy vs NovGames

{% tab title="OpenSpy" %}
![OpenSpy Server List](../.gitbook/assets/reclamation\_orig.png)



* English-speaking community
* All unlockable items are unlocked

{% hint style="info" %}
​You don't have to play ranked servers to rank up because you got all the unlocks from the beginning.
{% endhint %}



* Players: 10+ players on weekdays, 30+ at weekends, on Reclamation server​s​
* Servers: Reclamation EU, Reclamation US
* Community: Reclamation \[Discord]
* Gamemodes: Conquest, Conquest Coop
* ​Requirements: Install OpenSpy Components via BF2142 Hub
* Requirements: Install Reclamation's map pack (3.8 GB) or maps that the server is running upon



OpenSpy is recommended over NovGames if you just want to play Project Remaster's coops (both singleplayer and LAN) while having all the unlocks.

![NovGames Server List](../.gitbook/assets/novgame\_orig.png)



* Russin-speaking community
* All unlockable items are **NOT** unlocked

{% hint style="info" %}
​You have to play ranked servers to rank up and unlock those items by yourself.
{% endhint %}



* More players: 40+ players on weekdays, 50+ at weekends, on ALLIANCE servers
* Servers: ALLIANCE Mix, ALLIANCE INFANTRY
* Community: NovGames \[Discord]
* Gamemodes: Titan, No Vehicles
* Requirements: Install NovGames Components via BF2142 Hub + Run NovGames Activator once

{% hint style="info" %}
NovGames Activator changes your cd key so that you don't get auto-kicked on Alliance's servers.
{% endhint %}

__

I would recommend this over OpenSpy if you just want to play on a public server and enjoy the vanilla multiplayer experience, especially the Titan mode.​

## Installing OpenSpy Components

We will first go through the installation of OpenSpy Components.&#x20;

That's because you can use all the unlocks later when you test the game.&#x20;

This is important because you will always find yourself playing with bots (i.e. Conquest Coop) most of the time in single-player, so OpenSpy is really the only way to go.&#x20;

Rest assured that we will also guide you through how to switch over to NovGames just in case you want to play some vanilla multi-player games with real people.

{% hint style="info" %}
​Before proceeding to patch your game, you're strongly advised to backup the following files in your game folder: **`BF2142.exe`**, **`RendDX9.dll`**
{% endhint %}

1. Right-click the "**BF2142 Hub**" shortcut on your desktop. \
   Click "**Properties**". In the "**Compatibility**" tab, enable "**Run this program as an administrator**".\
   Click "**Apply**" and then click "**OK**".
2. Double click the shortcut to run the app.
3. Click "**Yes**" when the dialogue "**Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device?**" pops up.
4. In the "**Help**" (question mark icon) tab, check whether the "**GamePath**" is pointed to the correct destination or not. If it's not, click the gear icon to locate your game folder.
5. Select "**OpenSpy**" from the "**Redirects\***" drop-down menu. Click the "**Install**" button.
6. Click "**Yes**" when the dialogue "**Are you sure you want to patch the game?**" pops up.
7. Click "**Confirm**" when the dialogue "**Patch completed, Enjoy!**" pops up.
8. Make sure all checkmarks (i.e. Patch 1.51, BF2142.exe, RendDX9.d, RendDX9ori.dll) are green after patching.\

   \
   Steps 9-11 are optional as they are only required if you want to play on Reclamation's servers.\
   \
   The Reclamation Community uses their own version of maps. So, in order to play on their servers, you will have to install their map pack or the map that the server is currently running upon.\
   __
9. In the "**Download**" tab, double click on "**BF2142 MapPack v1.0**". The app will then open your browser and navigate to the download link of the pack. Download "**`2142_MapPack_v1.zip`**" (MediaFire, 3.8GB).
10. Once the download is completed, click the "**MapPack Installer \***" button and select the .zip file you've downloaded.
11. A command-line window will pop up. Once the installation is completed, the window will close itself.
12. If everything looks good, close the app.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Step 9:** There is an option to download the maps individually. To do so, you may refer to the following instructions:



1. In the "**Download**" tab, click "**Individual Maps**".&#x20;
2. Select the maps that you want to download from the "**Available Maps**" box and click "**>>**".&#x20;
3. To uninstall a map, select the map from the "**Installed Maps**" box and click "**<<**".
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Reclamation's servers are unmodded, i.e. vanilla servers.

The downloaded maps are installed in the "**`/mods/bf2142/Levels`**" folder, i.e. vanilla folder.
{% endhint %}

## Installing NovGames Components

​You can only connect to one master server at a time, so you don't have to install NovGames components if you already have OpenSpy components installed. But you can still do so if you want to switch from OpenSpy to NovGames.

{% hint style="info" %}
Warning: NovGames is currently offline. (As of 8 May 2022)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To switch between the 2 master servers, select the corresponding master server in the drop-down menu of BF2142 Hub and click "**Install**" to install the components.
{% endhint %}

1. Follow the steps from the above section.&#x20;
2. Select "**NovGames**" instead of "**GameSpy**" in step 5 and skip steps 9-11. \
   NovGames components do not include RendDX9\_ori.dll, so there will be no checkmark on that option after patching.
3. Download [Activator2142\_by\_NovGames.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qsBgh3wqvsP9v5JUk6Xr\_Nd5UzqVyWOd/view?usp=sharing).
4. Run it as an administrator.
5. Click "**EN**", and then click "**ACTIVATE**".
6. Close the app once the "**Completed!**" message appears in the diagnose box.

{% hint style="info" %}
_​_You only have to run this app once, and you may delete it afterwards. The activator will replace your old cd key with a new key in your game's registry path. __ This allows the key to uniquely identify yourself so you don't get auto-kicked on Alliance's servers.
{% endhint %}

Similarly, you can switch from NovGames to OpenSpy using BF2142 Hub.
