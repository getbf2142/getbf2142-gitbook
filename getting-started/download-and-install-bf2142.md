## Downloads

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Primary Sources" %}
**Battlefield 2142 Standard Edition v1.01**

The setup provided under this section is an image of the <mark style="color:blue;">Standard Edition</mark> retail DVD disc and it contains the following language options:

English, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Russian

Since this setup only holds an early version (i.e.,`v1.01`) of the game, you [**must**](#user-content-fn-6)[^6] follow the instructions in the [next tutorial](download-and-install-v1\_51-patch.md) right after finishing all the steps in this tutorial to have the game correctly patched to the latest version  (i.e.,`v1.51`).

**If you are new to the game or the modding process, we suggest always sticking to the primary sources as they are the main references we use throughout our tutorials.**

If you have concerns about the sources we provide, try installing an AntiVirus in advance or downloading the base game from sources that you trust. It is very important that you feel comfortable with what you are doing here.

{% hint style="info" %}
As the game has been nothing but abandoned by the developers and its publisher, this setup is uploaded purely for the purpose of preserving video game history.
{% endhint %}

Note that this is not really a legit way to download the game. However, this is becoming the only option left to get the game nowadays apart from buying a second-hand copy from Amazon that doesn't allow you to log in anymore.

**Battlefield 2142 Deluxe Edition v1.51**\
_Novgames Alliance Edition (2016) - Russian Community_

The setup provided under this section is prepared by Novgames for its Russian-speaking community. The installer will forcibly[^7] install the Russian locale and the [latest version](#user-content-fn-8)[^8] of the game.

If you choose to download the game from the following links, you may skip the part about [patching the game](download-and-install-v1\_51-patch.md) to `v1.51`. You also do not have to worry about the serial keys as the installer [does not](#user-content-fn-9)[^9] require one.

**Battlefield 2142 Deluxe Edition v1.51**

The only way to obtain the game "legitimately" is to buy a second-hand retail DVD. A used copy usually means the product key is activated or expired. Though this may have defeated the purpose of spending money on it, nostalgia is always a good reason to support an old title like this.

If you really like the game and have some extra money to spend, we do encourage buying one yourself. It may seem unobvious at first but actually many of the die-hards own a physical copy of the game. Some even got the disc as early as in 2005. As we always say, we are real Battlefield lovers, and that's why we made this website.

[^3]: When asked for a serial, use: E6HH-DWUG-U8X1-R8F0-1911. Continue the game setup until the installation is completed – do not download GameSpy Arcade and do not register to EA servers. More remarks are provided [here](download-and-install-bf2142.md#wizard-remarks).

[^4]: Since the game isn't patched to the latest version, if you try to launch the game, it will ask you to insert the game disc. Details as to why this is happening will be discussed [here](download-and-install-v1\_51-patch.md).

[^5]: If you skip patching the game to the latest version, you won't be able to launch the game as it will keep asking you to insert the game disc. Details as to why this is happening will be discussed [here](download-and-install-v1\_51-patch.md).
