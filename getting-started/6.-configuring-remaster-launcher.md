1. Double click the "**Remaster Launcher**" shortcut on your desktop to start the launcher.
2. Click "**Yes**" when the dialogue "**Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device**?" pops up.
3. ~~Go to the "**Play**" tab.~~
4. ~~In the "**Launch-Settings**" section, enable "**4GB Ram Patch**".~~
5. Go to the "**Settings**" tab.
6. In the "**General**" section, enable "**Unlock FPS (allows 120HZ)**", "**Widescreen Fix**", "**HUD-Fix**", **"Blood Patch**" and "**Reshade**". <mark style="color:red;">Do</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**NOT**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">touch the resolution settings yet!</mark>
7. Go to the "**Help**" tab.
8. Check whether the debug message appears as follows:\
   <mark style="color:green;">Check version: v1.51 OK!</mark>\
   <mark style="color:red;">bf2142.exe: Not v1.51 or cracked.</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;">bf2142\_4gb.exe: Missing! Patch first.</mark>\
   <mark style="color:green;">Profile: Missing. That's OK!</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;"></mark>\ <mark style="color:green;"></mark>If you have OpenSpy components installed, then:\
   <mark style="color:red;">RendDX9.dll: Wrong file version!</mark>\
   <mark style="color:green;">RendDX9\_ori.dll: OK!</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;"></mark>\ <mark style="color:green;"></mark>If you have NovGames components installed, then:\
   <mark style="color:green;">RendDX9.dll: No OpenSpy, use BF2142Unlocker to play online!</mark>\
   <mark style="color:green;">RendDX9\_ori.dll: OK!</mark> **OR** <mark style="color:green;">No OpenSpy, use BF2142Unlocker to play online!</mark>

10. ~~Click "**Confirm**" when a dialogue saying "**Something went wrong.**" pops up.~~
11. ~~Switch to a random tab and then go back to the "**Help**" tab. Now, the line that contains "**bf2142\_4gb.exe**" should still be in red colour with the message changed to "**Corrupted! Patch again.**".~~
12. Go to the "**Play**" tab. Click the button "**Start Game!**" to start the game for the first time.
13. Once the login screen appears, click the "**x**" button in the upper right-hand corner to close the game.

    <mark style="color:yellow;">Profile: Found, delete if stuck with blackscreen.</mark>
17. Go to the "**Settings**" tab.
18. In the "**General**" section, configure the game resolution from the drop-down menu.
19. Close the launcher.

**Step 4:** Battlefield 2142 is a 32-bit game. It can only use at most 4GB of RAM. The 4GB RAM Patch avoids your game from crashing from time to time due to memory overthrow.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The OpenSpy patch already includes 4GB RAM Patch by default. Steps regarding the deployment of that fix can be ignored.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
~~**Step 9:** Every time you switch between OpenSpy and NovGames, you have to manually delete "**`bf2142_4gb.exe`**" from your game folder and then apply the 4GB Memory Patch using the launcher. The reason is that bf2142.exe contains info of the master server, and the launcher creates bf2142\_4gb.exe directly based on bf2142.exe. That's why you also have to update bf2142\_4gb.exe for things to work. If not, you won't be able to connect to the new master server.â€‹~~
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Step 12:** This allows the game to create the default profiles in your Documents folder at "**`C:\Users\xxxx\Documents\Battlefield 2142\`**".

It may take a while for the game to start. So you may expect a few seconds of black screen before the intro comes up. If you're running the game in full-screen mode, you will probably see your black screen blinking or resizing for a few seconds before something shows up. That's normal. Just get used to it.

Something you should know:



1. If you want to play an unmodded vanilla game or to join an unmodded vanilla server, simply uncheck everything under the "**Launch-Settings**" section of the "**Play**" tab and under the "**General**" section of the "**Settings**" tab before launching the game.
2. "**Vanilla weapons**" (Project\_Remaster\_v14\_vanilla\_weapons) is a mini-mod of Project Remaster. You may check this option if you want to play a Project Remaster game with weapons or gadgets having their vanilla stats (damage, recoil, rate of fire, amount of ammo, etc.).
3. The "**Play Offline**" tab is a portal to launch the offline single-player mini-mod. It's a derivative of the main mod that bypasses the master server while having the customization feature disabled.
4. You can configure the Reshade overlay in-game using the shortcut "**Shift+F2**". You may turn off the LUT while playing some of the maps if it's causing problems (graphics glitch) for you.
