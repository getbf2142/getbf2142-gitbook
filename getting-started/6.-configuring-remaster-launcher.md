**Step 4:** Battlefield 2142 is a 32-bit game so it can at most utilise 4GB of RAM. But better than not, the 4GB RAM Patch avoids your game from crashing from time to time due to memory overthrow. We have to disable the option here because the OpenSpy patch from BF2142 Hub already includes that fix by default.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Step 12:** This allows the game to create the default profiles in your Documents folder at "**`C:\Users\xxxx\Documents\Battlefield 2142\`**".

It may take a while for the game to start. So you may expect a few seconds of black screen before the intro comes up. If you're running the game in full-screen mode, you will probably see your black screen blinking or resizing for a few seconds before something shows up. That's normal. Just get used to it.

Something you should know:



1. If you want to play an unmodded vanilla game or to join an unmodded vanilla server, simply uncheck everything under the "**Launch-Settings**" section of the "**Play**" tab and under the "**General**" section of the "**Settings**" tab before launching the game.
2. "**Vanilla weapons**" (Project\_Remaster\_v14\_vanilla\_weapons) is a mini-mod of Project Remaster. You may check this option if you want to play a Project Remaster game with weapons or gadgets having their vanilla stats (damage, recoil, rate of fire, amount of ammo, etc.).
3. The "**Play Offline**" tab is a portal to launch the offline single-player mini-mod. It's a derivative of the main mod that bypasses the master server while having the customization feature disabled.
4. You can configure the Reshade overlay in-game using the shortcut "**Shift+F2**". You may turn off the LUT while playing some of the maps if it's causing problems (graphics glitch) for you.
