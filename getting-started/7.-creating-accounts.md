# 7. Creating Accounts

OpenSpy and NovGames are separate systems, and they do not share data with each other. You will have to register separate accounts in order to log on to their servers.&#x20;

For now, just stick to the one you have installed to complete the registration. You're strongly advised to use the same Account Name, Password and Soldier for both servers.

## Registration

{% hint style="danger" %}
Windows Firewall may pop up if it's your first time logging in to the game.
{% endhint %}

1. Double-click the "**Remaster Launcher**" shortcut on your desktop to start the launcher.
2. Click "**Yes**" when the dialogue "**Do you want to allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your device**?" pops up.
3. On the "**Play**" tab, click the "**Start Game!**" button.
4. On the login screen, click "**CREATE NEW ACCOUNT**"
5. Ignore the warning message "**EA MASTER SERVER IS DOWN. PLEASE USE BF2142UNLOCKER**" if you see it.
6. Click "**ACCEPT TERMS**".
7. Fill in the registration form with fake data. But please remember your **Account Name** and **Password**.
8. Click "**CREATE**".
9. Click "**CREATE NEW SOLDIER**". Type in the soldier name that you want and click "**CREATE NEW SOLDER**".
10. You may notice some changes to the game resolution.
11. To fix this, go to "**OPTIONS**", and then "**VIDEO**" to configure the video settings. Change the resolution first before touching the video quality settings.
12. Set "**ANTI-ALIASING**" to "**Off**" to avoid problems.
13. Don't forget to adjust the "**AUDIO**" settings as well!​
14. Congratulations! You have completed all the necessary steps to get Battlefield 2142 working! Now you may close the game to make the video settings applied.

**Step 4:** It takes time for the server to process your requests because most Master Servers are located somewhere in Europe or America. The master server is not down if you can receive a response from it within 10 seconds.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Step 5:** You're strongly advised to use fake data, such as a random email, date of birth and country.

Most master servers save your account data in plaintext. That's why don’t use passwords that you use anywhere else! The same goes for your email address.&#x20;

Recommended Password: `12344321`\
``Recommended email: `a.com@xxx.com`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Step 8:** You see the resolution glitch because you've created a new OpenSpy account and a soldier that associates with it, so the game creates a new set of profiles for you which only includes the default resolution settings.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Step 9:** You're highly advised to use the same resolution you've selected in the launcher. In that way, you won't experience this kind of resolution glitches anymore after logging in.
{% endhint %}
