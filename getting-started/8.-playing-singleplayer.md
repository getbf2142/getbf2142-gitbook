# 8. Playing Singleplayer

## 1. Setting up a quick game in "SINGLEPLAY"&#x20;

This option doesn't give you many configurable settings and is therefore a limited experience! You cannot adjust options like ticket ratio, team ratio, round time, friendly-fire, spawn time, etc.

However, when OpenSpy components are installed, the customization screen will be working and all unlockable equipment will be available for use.

{% hint style="info" %}
​You should be knowing how to launch and log in to the game using the launcher by now.
{% endhint %}

1. Log in to the game.
2. Click "**SINGLEPLAY**".
3. Configure your game and click "**START PLAYLIST**".

## **2. Setting up a LAN server in "MULTIPLAY"**

This option allows you to edit much more game settings! You can adjust options like ticket ratio, team ratio, round time, friendly-fire, spawn time, etc.&#x20;

In addition, when OpenSpy components are installed, the customization screen will be working and all unlockable equipment will be available for use.

{% hint style="info" %}
​You should be knowing how to launch and log in to the game using the launcher by now.
{% endhint %}

1. ​Log in to the game.
2. ​Click "**MULTIPLAY**".
3. Click "**LOCAL**".
4. Click "**CREATE**".
5. Configure your game and click "**START SERVER**".

## 3. Launching the Offline Mini-Mod

​With this option, you enter the game without connecting to a master server or an internet connection, hence the name "offline".&#x20;

The customization screen will not work, but you can still get some unlocks from the pre-defined soldier load-outs and kit load-outs. Loot fallen bots' dead bodies to get different primary rifles.&#x20;

Anyway, you should only consider this option when all master servers are down.

{% hint style="info" %}
​You should be knowing how to launch and log in to the game using the launcher by now.
{% endhint %}

1. Start the launcher.
2. Go to "**Play Offline**" tab. Click "**Play offline**".
3. On the login screen, click "**LOGIN**" without typing in your password.
4. Follow the steps in Option 1 or Option 2.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Step 3:** If this doesn't work, ​change the account name to "**singleplayer**" and press "**LOGIN**".
{% endhint %}

## Remarks

1. Use the launcher to configure the number of bots. Set it to an odd number so that the team can be balanced.
2. The customization screen is only available for options 1 and 2 with OpenSpy. It will not work in option 3.
3. Windows Firewall may pop up if it's your first time hosting a LAN server (Option 2).
